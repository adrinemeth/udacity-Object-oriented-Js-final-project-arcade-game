frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
Object oriented arcade game that uses class and class prototype functions - my solution to the final project of Udacity course "Object oriented javascript". The game is scalable with additional functionalities, I am developing it as my time allows.

Instructions to the game
===============================
The goal of my game is to score as many points as possible by collecting gems. 
The game can be won and reset by crossing the bug-fields and jumping into the water.
Beware, because if you collide with bugs you lose valuable points and have to return to the initial field. 
Bugs can also eat gems if you're not fast enough.
